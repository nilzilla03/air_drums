# air_drums
My first image processing/computer vision project. Simulating drums but without the drums, using a bottom-up facing webcam. Written in Python and OpenCV. Pretty simple project, was part of club work and we showcased this along with other projects in front of the dining halls in college. It's dependent on detecting circles, which in turn is dependent on the amount of noise the camera picks up. Basically, it performed pretty bad if the lighting wasn't great. If I had to do this again, I probably wouldn't make it in software only; but if I had to, I'd probably use feed from two cameras (a bottom up camera and a side view camera). Could be improved if the drumsticks had IMU sensors on it. Still a small, fun project though.
